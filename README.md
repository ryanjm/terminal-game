# Console Game

Not sure the exact direction to take this yet. Just brainstorming.

## Capture the flag

Simple.

2D array with a randomly placed flag. Display map. Ability to guess where the flag is. Track guessed positions and show them on the map. Show some stats (# of guesses, length of game) at the end.

What it would cover:

* Classes
* rand()
* 2D arrays
* instance variables
* basic times
* gets
* puts

## Robot Wars

??

The idea would be to be able to battle two classes or projects together. The problem with this would be that in order to have something to battle over you need something that can be improved. This is usually a path algorithm (how to go about walking) and that is out of the scope of this project. Though... might be fun for an alumni project.

## Minesweeper

Medium.

Does anyone even like minesweeper enough to play it? Same as capture the flag except you throw in some bombs and hints about the area you guessed.

## File Manager

Easy.

Rename a bunch of files or create random text files in a bunch of sub folders. Would be fun to manipulate the folder structure and would be practical for some people, but working with Files isn't directly related to RoR.

## Weather App

Easy.

Expand on the challenge. Get weather data. Give some suggestions of what to do based on the weather.

What it would cover:

* Classes
* rand()
* arrays (for ideas)
* hashes (for weather -> ideas)
* json
* api call
